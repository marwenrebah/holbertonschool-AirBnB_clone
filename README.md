## AirBnB Clone Project - Console Phase 🏠🔄

## Overview 🌐

The AirBnB Clone project is designed to replicate the functionality of Airbnb, an online platform that connects people with homes to offer with those in need of temporary accommodation. The project is divided into several phases, starting with the development of a command-line interface (CLI) to manage AirBnB objects.

This README focuses on the first stage, the Console Phase, where we establish the foundation for managing AirBnB objects using Python.

## Project Structure 📚

The project is structured around the following core Python concepts:

- Import
- Exceptions
- Class
- Private attribute
- Getter / Setter
- Class method
- Static method
- Inheritance
- Unittest
- Read / Write file
- args and kwargs
- Serialization / Deserialization
- JSON

## Next Steps ➡️

With the console phase complete, the next steps involve bringing the project to life by developing a front-end for user interaction. This will be achieved step-by-step, starting with the design and prototyping of HTML static pages.

## Phases of the Project 🚀

1. **Console Phase:**
   - Implemented a command-line interface for managing AirBnB objects.
   - Covered various Python concepts to ensure a robust foundation.

2. **HTML Prototyping:**
   - Create simple HTML static pages.
   - Develop a style guide for consistent design.
   - Add fake content for visual representation.
   - No JavaScript involved in this phase.
   - Data is not loaded from any external source.
